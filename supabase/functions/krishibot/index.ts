      care: "Ensure proper irrigation especially during flowering. Apply nitrogen fertilizer in split doses. Keep watch for rust and powdery mildew.",
      harvesting: "Harvest when grain is hard and moisture content is below 14%. Use combine harvester for efficiency.",
      pests: "Common pests include aphids, armyworms, and Hessian fly. Implement integrated pest management strategies.",
    },
    rice: {
      planting: "Prepare seedbeds and transplant seedlings when they are 20-25 days old. Direct seeding is also possible in suitable conditions.",
      care: "Maintain standing water of 2-5cm. Apply fertilizers based on soil tests. Weed management is crucial in the first 40 days.",
      harvesting: "Harvest when 80-85% of grains turn golden yellow. Moisture content should be around 20-25% for optimal harvesting.",
      pests: "Watch for stem borers, plant hoppers, and rice blast disease. Use resistant varieties and appropriate pesticides if necessary.",

      care: "Requires regular watering especially during tasseling and silking. Side-dress with nitrogen when plants are 30cm tall.",
      harvesting: "Harvest when kernels are fully formed and husks are dry. Kernels should be firm and not dented when pressed.",
      pests: "Common issues include corn earworm, European corn borer, and corn smut. Rotate crops and use targeted pesticides if needed.",

      planting: "Plant seed potatoes 10-15cm deep and 25-30cm apart when soil temperature reaches 7-10°C.",
      care: "Hill the soil around plants as they grow. Maintain consistent moisture. Apply balanced fertilizer before planting.",
      harvesting: "Harvest after vines have died back naturally or 2-3 weeks after killing vines chemically. Cure in dark place for 10-14 days.",
      pests: "Colorado potato beetle and late blight are major concerns. Implement crop rotation and use disease-free seed potatoes.",

      treatment: "Apply fungicides as a preventative or at first sign of disease. Remove and destroy infected plant material.",
      prevention: "Rotate crops, ensure adequate spacing for air circulation, avoid overhead watering, and use disease-resistant varieties."
    },
    "powdery mildew": {
      symptoms: "White powdery patches on leaves, stems, and sometimes fruit. May cause leaf distortion and premature leaf drop.",
      causes: "Fungal infection favored by high humidity but dry leaf conditions. Often worse in shade and moderate temperatures.",
      treatment: "Apply sulfur-based fungicides or potassium bicarbonate. Neem oil can also be effective for mild cases.",
      prevention: "Increase air circulation, plant in sunny locations, avoid over-fertilizing with nitrogen, and use resistant varieties."
    },
    "rust": {
      symptoms: "Rusty-colored pustules on leaves and stems. Severe infections cause leaf yellowing and defoliation.",
      causes: "Fungal pathogens that thrive in moist conditions, moderate temperatures, and extended leaf wetness.",
      treatment: "Apply fungicides containing tebuconazole or chlorothalonil. Remove heavily infected plants to prevent spread.",
      prevention: "Avoid wetting foliage when watering, space plants properly, remove plant debris after the growing season."
    },
    "bacterial wilt": {
      symptoms: "Sudden wilting of plants despite adequate moisture. Cut stems may ooze bacterial slime when placed in water.",
      causes: "Soil-borne bacteria that enter through wounds in roots or stems, often spread by insects or contaminated tools.",
      treatment: "No effective chemical treatment. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent spread.",
      prevention: "Rotate crops, control insect vectors like cucumber beetles, sanitize tools, and use resistant varieties if available."
    },
    "mosaic virus": {
      symptoms: "Mottled pattern of light and dark green or yellow on leaves. May include leaf distortion and stunted growth.",
      causes: "Viral pathogens transmitted primarily by aphids and other sap-sucking insects. Can also spread through contaminated tools.",
      treatment: "No cure available. Remove and destroy infected plants to prevent spread to healthy plants.",
      prevention: "Control aphid populations, wash hands and sanitize tools between plants, use virus-resistant varieties."

  generalFarming: {
    soilHealth: "Maintain soil health through regular testing, crop rotation, cover cropping, and appropriate organic matter addition. Healthy soil leads to resilient crops.",
    irrigation: "Implement efficient irrigation methods like drip irrigation to conserve water. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth.",
    sustainablePractices: "Adopt sustainable farming practices like integrated pest management, conservation tillage, and organic fertilization to reduce environmental impact.",
    weatherAdaptation: "Stay informed about local weather patterns and climate predictions. Plan planting and harvesting around expected weather conditions.",
    marketAwareness: "Research market trends and demands before deciding what to grow. Consider value-added products to increase farm income."
